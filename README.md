# DSCI-100-group-project-

A knn classification project completed in R programming language for the course DSCI 100 offered at UBC Vancouver (Winter 2020)

User knowledge dataset (Kahraman, 2013) is about developing intuitive knowledge classifier and modeling of users' domain dependent data in web (Kahrman, 2009).The goal of this project is to predict user knowledge by coming up with a model based on predictor variables to classify the level of user knowledge. Alongside factors such as exam performance, degree of study time and other such variables, we want to explore the effect these factors have on predicting the user knowledge level (UNS). The project will answer the question that given a random user vector with five corresponding data (STG, SCG, LPR, PEG), we can classify which study level the user belongs to. The dataset has 6 columns (5 variables and 1 classifier), which are as following:

- STG: The degree of study time for goal object materails
- SCG: The degree of repetition number of user for goal object materails
- STR: The degree of study time of user for related objects with goal object
- LPR: The exam performance of user for related objects with goal object
- PEG: The exam performance of user for goal objects
- UNS: The knowledge level of user
